“This book dives into the interconnected realms of Generative AI and Cybersecurity crafted with the guidance in ethics. It offers a comprehensive exploration of their interplay in today's digital landscape, and empowers students, educators and practitioners alike. It also covers the human factor and the decision-making process in vision the interdisciplinary future.”

“There are few disciplines that have evolved with greater velocity in the last decade, both for the better and for the worse, than Cybersecurity and Generative AI. Ethical development and administration of these paradigms, particularly in concert, is a staggeringly blurry area that Dr. Islam takes the first steps to bring clarity to with this work. Disregard the teachings of this book at your own risk!" 
-	Dr. Brian Dougherty, Vice President of Engineering, SNAPPT

"The advent of generative AI marked a tectonic shift that has created both incredible opportunities and deep vulnerabilities for us all. In the midst of such fundamental change, this timely and critical book will provide a much-needed guide for those seeking to understand and navigate this new era of intelligence.” 
-	Fiona J McEvoy, AI ethics writer, researcher, speaker, and thought leader | Founder, YouTheData.com | Women in AI Ethics™ – Hall of Fame

“AI is here to stay, and the US government knows this. In March of 2024, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued Memorandum M-24-10 to guide federal agencies on the responsible use of AI, outlining directives and practices aimed at ensuring that AI technologies are used ethically, transparently, and effectively in government operations. The U.S. White House recognizes the importance, impacts, and inherent risks associated with this perplexing topic. Fortunately, this book will be an essential resource to those responsible for taking on the ever-present cyber security threats in the midst of this emerging AI landscape, while gaining insights into ethical considerations surrounding the creation and integration of such technologies.”
-	Jared Linder, IT Program Manager for the Export-Import Bank of the United States
<br>
<br>
“While many new books about Generative AI focus on the excitement (and hyperbole) present in the field, Ray has put together a thoughtful and applicable work that takes a serious look at the complexity present in the intersection of AI, cybersecurity, and ethics.  I’m very pleased to see these topics analyzed as a critical system. Clearly this must be better understood in the light of the real world before our information is truly secure and we are able to take advantage of the great positive potential of AI in this space.”
-	W. Tod Newman, former Lead of Raytheon's Center for Artificial Intelligence 
and founder of Santa Cruz River Analytics

“Cyber security is not a bolt-on activity or exercise, but an integral and initial component of any system development or modification. The practitioner must have an adherence to excellence and be confident that they are adding value in support of the client’s organizational goals, and objectives, whilst lessoning their risk and vulnerabilities, and creating efficiencies.”
-	Paul Wells, President & CEO, NETWAR Defense Corporation
